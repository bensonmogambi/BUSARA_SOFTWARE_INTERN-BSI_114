# Mini Ultimatum Game with Exit Survey

## Description

Welcome to the Mini Ultimatum Game, a social science experiment that delves into decision-making and human behavior. This project combines the Mini Ultimatum Game with an Exit Survey to gain deeper insights

### Mini Ultimatum Game

In this game, you will take on one of three roles:

- **Player 1:** You decide how much to send to Player 2.
- **Player 2:** You receive the offer from Player 1.
- **Player 3 (the Punisher):** You determine whether to punish Player 1 for an unfair offer.

Challenge your decision-making skills and discover the impact of your choices. Will you cooperate or compete? The results may surprise you.

### Game Flow

- **Page 1:** Player 1 is told that they have been endowed with Ksh 200 and are asked to send any amount between 0 and 200 to Player 2.

- **Page 2:** Player 3 sees the amount that Player 1 has decided to send to Player 2 and decides whether to Punish or Not Punish Player 1.

- **Page 3 - Results Page:** Player 1 and Player 2 will be notified of the results, including the amount Player 1 sent, Player 3's decision, and the resulting payouts.
